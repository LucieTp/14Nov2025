The idea is to create triathlon game, in which you need to complete a 1.5 km swim, a 26.5 km bike and a 10 km run (= 28 km).
The gpx of this course needs to be birthday related (i.e. a cake, or spell out happy birthday, not sure yet).

Elements I would like to integrate :

A main map with the three courses (I was thinking it would be a single large map)

Game characteristics :
- A clock 
- A bar that saves how much of the course has been completed

The player loose if they have not completed the course within xxx time

The player can pick up food that will make it go faster

(1) Swim : 
- the player needs to pick up wetsuit
- the avatar needs to change into the wetsuit
- he can then jump in the water (swimming avatar if possible)
- the course will be indicated by hoops that disappear once they have been crossed. 
- the player needs to avoid jellyfish which will be swimming around (will have time penalities if they touch a jellyfish)

(2) Bike :
- the player needs to pick up its bike
- the avatar changes to a cyclist
- again, following the hoops (can't keep going with the course if they miss a hoop)
- can pick up food that will make it go faster (pop corn)
- can have time penalities if they hit a rock (flat tire)

(3) Run :
- the player needs to put on their shoes
- the avatar changes to runner
- can pick up food to go faster (pop corn)
- not sure what will be challenging on the run (could have lots of other runners blocking them, or have to jump over tree branches, idk


To do:

- Create the general map 
- Add hoops, food and obstacles 
- Create the function that checks that hoops have been crossed 
- Create and display the clock
- Create a bar that shows how much of the course has been completed
- Create the game over function
- Make a initial window display which explains the rules
- Learn how to add objects and get the player to pick them up
- Make a function that makes it go faster for xx time if picked up food
- Make a time penalty function

Optional :
- Animate the sprite
